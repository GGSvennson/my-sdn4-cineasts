It's been four years since the alien-seeking agents averted an intergalactic disaster of epic proportions. And now it's a race against the clock as Jay must convince Kay-who not only has absolutely no memory of his time spent with the Men In Black, but is also the only living person left with the expertise to save the galaxy-to reunite with the MIB before the earth submits to ultimate destruction.","popularity":2.796351,"poster_path":"/qWjRfBwr4VculczswwojXgoU0mq.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Columbia Pictures","id":5},{"name":"Amblin Entertainment","id":56},{"name":"Columbia Pictures Corporation","id":441},{"name":"Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation","id":49325}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-07-03","revenue":441818803,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Same Planet.
