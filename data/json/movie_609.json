Nelson stars as Steve Freeling, the main protagonist, who lives with his wife, Diane, and their three children, Dana, Robbie, and Carol Anne, in Southern California where he sells houses for the company that built the neighborhood. It starts with just a few odd occurrences, such as broken dishes and furniture moving around by itself. However, a tree comes alive and takes Robbie through his bedroom window, and Carol Anne is abducted by ghosts. Realizing that something evil haunts his home, Steve calls in a team of parapsychologists led by Dr. Lesh to investigate, hoping to get Carol Anne back, so he can remove his family from the house before it's too late.","popularity":1.662008,"poster_path":"/hKs6umpuLSgZhOiZI1pxpO0iVTQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"SLM Production Group","id":396},{"name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)","id":8411}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-10-29","revenue":122200000,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're here.","title":"Poltergeist","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":323,"credits":{"cast":[{"cast_id":21,"character":"Steve Freeling","credit_id":"52fe425dc3a36847f80189dd","id":8977,"name":"Craig T.
