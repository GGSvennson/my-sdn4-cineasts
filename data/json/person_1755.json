{"adult":false,"also_known_as":[],"biography":"Majel Barrett-Roddenberry  (born Majel Leigh Hudec; February 23, 1932 – December 18, 2008) was an American actress and producer. She is perhaps best known for her role as Nurse Christine Chapel in the original Star Trek series, and for being the voice of most onboard computer interfaces throughout the series. She was also the wife of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. As a result of her marriage to Gene Roddenberry and her ongoing relationship with Star Trek – participating in some way in every series to date – she was sometimes referred to as \"the First Lady of Star Trek\". She and Gene Roddenberry were married in Japan on August 6, 1969, after the cancellation of the Star Trek: The Original Series. They had one son together, Eugene \"Rod\" Roddenberry, Jr., born in 1974.\n\nDescription above from the Wikipedia article Majel Barrett, licensed under CC-BY-SA, full list of contributors on Wikipedia","birthday":"1932-02-23","deathday":"2008-12-18","homepage":"","id":1755,"imdb_id":"nm0000854","name":"Majel Barrett","place_of_birth":"Columbus, Ohio, USA","popularity":0.70875,"profile_path":"/6esZeIlIdrCnoGkAggRAJ8FWs7Z.jpg"}
