{"adult":false,"also_known_as":["Jackie Purves"],"biography":"Jack Purvis was a British film actor. Purvis was a dwarf, and thus was mainly cast in roles requiring actors of short stature. Purvis appeared as a different alien creature in each of the three films of the original Star Wars trilogy, and also appeared in three of director Terry Gilliam's early fantasy films: Time Bandits, Brazil, and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen. Several years before his death, Purvis became quadriplegic after breaking his neck in a car accident. He died in November 1997 at the age of 60.","birthday":"1937-07-13","deathday":"1997-11-21","homepage":"","id":132538,"imdb_id":"nm0701023","name":"Jack Purvis","place_of_birth":"London - England - UK","popularity":6.0E-6,"profile_path":"/tuFTY1jhlEgZm3vM80KdAEvHwNI.jpg"}
