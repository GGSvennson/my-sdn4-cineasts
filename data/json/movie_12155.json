At her engagement party, she escapes the crowd to consider whether to go through with the marriage and falls down a hole in the garden after spotting an unusual rabbit. Arriving in a strange and surreal place called 'Underland,' she finds herself in a world that resembles the nightmares she had as a child, filled with talking animals, villainous queens and knights, and frumious bandersnatches. Alice realizes that she is there for a reason--to conquer the horrific Jabberwocky and restore the rightful queen to her throne.","popularity":3.456179,"poster_path":"/pvEE5EN5N1yjmHmldfL4aJWm56l.jpg","production_companies":[{"name":"Walt Disney Pictures","id":2},{"name":"Team Todd","id":598},{"name":"Tim Burton
