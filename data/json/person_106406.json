Luis DeJesus had been a circus performer, but was actually quite infamous around New York in the Seventies for his role in a stag movie, a charming little ditty entitled The Anal Dwarf (1971). This eight-minute hardcore wonder was a regular attraction in 42nd Street peepshows, especially for people looking for something different. It was probably through this movie that the makers of \"Bloodsucking Freaks\" discovered DeJesus--\"Freaks\" director Joel M. Reed also shot porn at the time, though under a different name--but they got more than they bargained for. On the last day of shooting DeJesus and several other members of the cast shocked Reed by staging an orgy; according to Reed, DeJesus \"wasn't short in all departments\". DeJesus continued to act in porn way into the 1980s, then tried for a more mainstream career with disappointing results. Typical of Hollywood's miscasting of dwarf actors, the only roles were in films like Under the Rainbow (1981), a movie about the alleged wild behavior of the Munchkin cast during the filming of Le magicien d'Oz (1939). His last known role was as an Ewok.\n\nDeJesus was often mistaken for Hervé Villechaize\n\n. For years many critics thought it was the L'île fantastique (1977) actor who had to stand on a box to mount Veri Knottyin \"The Anal Dwarf\", despite their very different appearances.  - IMDb Mini Biography","birthday":"1952-06-30","deathday":"1988-07-27","homepage":"","id":106406,"imdb_id":"nm0208953","name":"Luis De Jesus","place_of_birth":"New York - USA","popularity":1.0E-6,"profile_path":null}
